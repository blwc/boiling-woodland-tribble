    <h3>Riker</h3>
    <p>About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. You enjoyed that. They were just sucked into space. How long can two people talk about nothing? Damage report! Besides, you look good in a dress. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Sorry, Data. I am your worst nightmare! I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Computer, belay that order. Well, that's certainly good to know. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I'll alert the crew. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Your shields were failing, sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Ensign Babyface! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. The unexpected is our normal routine. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? This should be interesting. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. What? We're not at all alike! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Talk about going nowhere fast. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Not if I weaken first. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. and attack the Romulans. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I'll be sure to note that in my log. Your head is not an artifact! Computer, lights up! What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We have a saboteur aboard. and attack the Romulans. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.
